I finished my PhD in space science in Dec, 2013 from the [SuperDARN lab](http://vt.superdarn.org/tiki-index.php) in Virginia Tech and am now working as a data scientist. 

I constantly try to learn new tools and software by working on some open source projects. Some of my projects are discussed here, few more are present in my [Github](https://github.com/bharatreddy) account. Over the last few years I taught myself Python, Javascript, JQUERY and visualization tools such as d3.js, by working on some projects. The latest tool I'm playing with is the awesome Pandas (Python) library.
