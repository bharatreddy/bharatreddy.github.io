I finished my PhD in space science in Dec, 2013 from the [SuperDARN lab](http://vt.superdarn.org/tiki-index.php) in Virginia Tech and am now working as a data scientist. 

I constantly try to learn new tools and software by working on some open source projects. Some of my projects are discussed in this blog, few more are present in my [Github](https://github.com/bharatreddy) account. Over the last few years I taught myself Python, Javascript, JQUERY and visualization tools such as d3.js, by working on some projects. The latest tool I'm playing with is the awesome Pandas (Python) library. 

Drop me an [email](mailto:bharatr@vt.edu) if anything interests you.

Thanks for reading!
