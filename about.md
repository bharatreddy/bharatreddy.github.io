I am currently a research assistant professor in the [ECE Department](https://ece.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech, where I conduct research on the near-Earth space environment and teach undergraduate and graduate courses in the electromagnetics area. My research is focused on Sub Auroral Polarization Streams (SAPS), High Frequency radio wave propagation, dynamics of mid-latitude sporadic-E and electrified MSTIDs. Some of my  recent publications on these topics can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-7i6xcAAAAAJ&hl=en). Please see my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bharat-kunduri/64/14a/9a0/) for additional details on my professional preparation.

Drop me an [email](mailto:bharatr@vt.edu) if anything interests you.

Thanks!
